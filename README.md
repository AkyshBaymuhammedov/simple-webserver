## Tech Stack
* ExpressJS
* JavaScript
* Docker
* Helm
* Github Actions

## How-To Guide:
### Start the application locally
To run the app locally first install the dependencies:\
`npm install`

Then run:\
`npm start`

This will start the service on `localhost:3000`.

### Build and Deploy the application
The application is built and deployed to the cluster using the CI/CD pipeline located under `.github\workflows`.
The pipeline has 3 stages and performs the following:
1. **build**: Build the docker image and push it to Azure Container Registry.
2. **publish**: Build the helm chart and publish it to Azure Container Registry.
3. **deploy**: Install the helm chart to the cluster.

The pipeline reuses a template located in the [workflow-templates repo](https://github.com/AkyshBaymuhammedov/workflow-templates). 
The actual code of the pipeline is located in the template.

As a prerequisite the pipeline needs the following secrets in github actions:
1. **ACR_REGISTRY**: Name of the Azure Container Registry.
2. **ACR_USERNAME**: Username for a Service Principal which has access to ACR.
3. **ACR_PASSWORD**: Password of the Service Principal.
4. **AZURE_CREDENTIALS**: Credentials for SP which has access to Azure Key Vault. (this is for fetching the kubeconfig)
5. **KEY_VAULT**: Name of the Key Vault.


To run the pipeline just push a change to the main branch (whether directly or via a pull request).
Or you can re-run an existing pipeline in the repo.
